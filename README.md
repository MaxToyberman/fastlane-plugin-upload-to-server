```

```

upload_to_server(
    endPoint: 'https://yourdomain.com/api/UploadFiles',
    multipartPayload: {
        // here goes any multipart data  you want to add 
        :param1 => 'param1data',
        :param2 => 'param2data',
    },
    headers: {
        //required headers
    },
    ipa: 'path to your apk',  #(Optional - will be taken from the gym step)

    )
  end

  desc "Submit a new version to my server"

      multipartPayload: {
        :appName => 'AIMobile',
